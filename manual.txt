                                Tutorial: T02 

How to compile: 

    Open the Linux system terminal. 

    Input command line “gcc proxy.c -o proxy’ and then press enter. 

How to configure: 

    Using the university computer, open the Firefox and go to the Preferences. 

    Find the network proxy and choose settings. 

    Then choose the HTTP proxy and input “localhost” into the first block. 

    Input the port number (between 8000 and 9000). 

    Input command line “./proxy” in the terminal to run this proxy. 

    Enter the port number as same as the previous in the network proxy. 

    Enter the 0 or 1 to choose whether you want the multi-thread or not. 

    Enter the number of spelling errors you want (normally about 5). 

    Then go back to the Firefox and open a new tab for the test page (if you have   already opened the test page then refresh the test page (using ctrl + shift + R)). 

Test process: 

    I do the test by using university computer in CPSC lab and its system is Linux and use the Firefox as the web browser. And the test page            is just like “pages.cpsc.ucalgary.ca/~carey/CPSC441/test1.html” and other test cases the professor give me.  

Bonus part: 

    Create the multi-thread after accepting the connection if the user chooses the multi-thread. 

    Thank you for reading!
